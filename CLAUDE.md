# Tutorials teaching Common Lisp using Real World Programs

## Purpose

This is a repository holding tutorials that teach Common Lisp concepts from beginner to intermediate and advance stage. The tutorials themselves are generated by an LLM (Claude Code) from Common Lisp Repositories on GitHub. The LLM also critiques the exercise solutions provided by the user

## How to generate tutorials

1. The subdirectory @programms containing GitHub Repositories an the form of git submodules. Go through the Common Lisp Source code in these directories and loop for Common Lisp idioms, patterns and concepts. ONLY look at Common Lisp Source code, do not look at test code or code in any other language

2. Turn each of the found Common Lisp idioms, patterns and concepts into a tutorial
   - The tutorial should refer to files / line numbers from the programms under @programms for example source code
   - The tutorial should be written in Emacs Org File format. 
   - Example source code should be both included in the Org file directly with the appropriate source code tags for Org mode as well as contain Org mode references to the actual source code
   - If the source code example is more than a 20 lines, shorten it by removing not relevant parts and replacing it with a Common Lisp comment containing '...'
   - Classify the tutorial as beginner, intermediate or advanced
   - A tutorial should be stored under the @tutorials subdirectory with further subdirectories called 'beginner', 'intermediate' and 'advanced'
   
## How to critique tutorial exercises

1. Read through the exercise(s) at the bottom of each tutorial

2. If there are Common Lisp file(s) provided under the @exercises <level>/<tutorial name> subdirectory, then analyse the file(s) in that subdirectory and determine if they solve the given exercise

3. Write your comments & critique on the provided solution in a file named "critique.org" in the same subdirectory. The file should be in Emacs Org file format

Only provide critique for tutorial exercises that have a solution provided under @exercises <level>/<tutorial name>, do not provide a critique for tutorial exercises without a solution

## Questions and Answers

1. Look through the provided excercise and look for ";;; LLM-QUESTION: ...". These are questions for you (the LLM) to answer

2. Provide the answer in the row below the question and prefix it with ";;; LLM-ANSWER: ..."
